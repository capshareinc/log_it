# LogIt

Simple ubiquitous method to write to the log. Writing out Rails.logger.info is way too hard. This is easier. And it has colors, so.... yay.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'log_it'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install log_it

Initialize it with

```
rake initialize_log_it
```
